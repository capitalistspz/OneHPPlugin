# OneHPPlugin

A mod for Death's Door that caps health at 1HP regardless of upgrades.

# Installation

Step 1. Install Bepinex for 64-bit - https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html

Step 2. Move `OneHPPlugin.dll` to `Bepinex/plugins/`
#### Note
Death's Door is 64-bit so you should get 64-bit Bepinex

#### Linux users
If you are running the game through wine/proton, you must set `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp=n,b"` as an environment variable. Alternatively set overrides in `winecfg`, (can be easily done for the steam version with `protontricks`).
